# Dice Simulation

we are simulating dice using only my available d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20
any strategy that may lead to infinite rolling of dices are banned.
Re-roll are not allowed. aka, let's suppose we want d19. one common strategy is to use d20 and if you r=20 re-roll. we are not allowing this. we want creative solutions using math
another constraint: all dices must be fair in some way.
r = roll (the number you rolled)
