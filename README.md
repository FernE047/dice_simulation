# Dice Simulation

This project started as a challenge to be able to simulate any dice from 1 to a 100 using only d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 and d20 rolls.
the rules were:

1. all dices created must be somewhat fair
2. no strategies that can lead to infinite re-rolls, even if the chances are small.

the exploration of this challenge can be read and studied on .\from_1_to_100

# New Start

after this exploration I wanted to make more dices, so now this repo became a collection of dice classes :D
